## About Me
I have a cross-disciplinary background in architecture and programming knowledge, along with practical application capabilities. I am familiar with Python syntax and concepts (OOP, Data Structure, Time Complexity, etc.),and I have a solid understanding of the theoretical foundations and operational principles of ML / DL models (RL, CNN, RNN, Transformer, etc.).Currently, I have applied this knowledge to personally implement numerous projects of varying scales, and have been responsible for performing ETL, semantic transformation, and software development on company clients’ database data.
Within a team setting, due to my interdisciplinary background, I am able to adopt non-traditional, non–computer-science-trained ways of thinking and communication,to assist communication and coordination between technical teams and other collaborating project departments,and to transform complex data into forms that are understandable and actionable for decision-making.
On a personal skill level, I have experience in data processing, ETL pipeline design, and API design.
