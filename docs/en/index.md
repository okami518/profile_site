## About Me
I have a background in architecture and urban-related fields, combined with knowledge and practical skills in programming. I am familiar with Python syntax and core concepts (OOP, Data Structure, Time Complexity, etc.), and have a solid understanding of the theoretical foundations and operational principles of ML / DL models (RL, CNN, RNN, Transformer, etc.).
Currently, I have applied these skills by implementing projects of various scales, and have worked on ETL processes, semantic transformation, and software development for company clients’ database data.
Within team environments, my interdisciplinary background enables me to communicate and coordinate effectively between technical teams and other collaborating project departments using non-traditional information engineering perspectives, and to transform complex data into understandable and actionable forms.
In terms of technical expertise, I have experience in data processing, ETL pipeline design, and API design, as well as experience in GIS analysis, spatial data processing, and data system integration.
